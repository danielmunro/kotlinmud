    We prefer logging to console instead of a File. Its very easy
    to pipe console output to a file and most organizations already
    have a log rotation setup in place. It can also be faster to use this
    approach vs using a FileAppender directly

    Async appenders can drastically speed up logging as well as your application's
    response time but with some potential drawbacks. Read more at.

    We prefer a default setting of WARN and turn on logging explicitly for
    any packages we care about. INFO is also a good choice. Going lower than INFO
    may log sensitive data such as passwords or api tokens via HTTP or networking
    libraries. Remember these defaults impact third party libraries as well.

    Often times the cost of logging is overlooked. Try a simple benchmark of
    logging in a tight loop a few million iterations vs not logging and see the difference.
    There are a few ways you can change logging levels on the fly in a running app.
    This could be a better solution than over logging.
